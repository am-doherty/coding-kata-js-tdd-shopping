===========================

TDD Shopping kata in javascript using Qunit.

This is my run through of the Shopping kata using Test Driven Development. Following a Preston CodeJo event introducing NodeJS and Vows test suite, I decided to try the kata again using Qunit as the test suite.  

Almost all commits represent a new test or tests added and successfully run, with code refactoring along the way.
